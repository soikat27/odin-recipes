        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>

        <li>1 (3 pound) cooked chicken, torn into shreds or cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>10 (6 inch) corn tortillas, cut into quarters</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 
            degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Saute 
            onion and bell peppers in the hot oil until warmed 
            through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add both cans of condensed soup, diced tomatoes with chile peppers, chicken broth, sour cream, cumin, ancho chile powder, oregano, and chipotle chile powder; mix until sauce is well-combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread a few tablespoons of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer with 1/2 of the chicken, 1/2 of the sauce, 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 of the tortillas.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread the remaining chicken over the tortillas. Spread all but 1/2 cup of the remaining sauce over the chicken, then top with another 1/3 of the Cheddar, and the remaining tortillas. Spread the remaining 1/2 cup over top, and sprinkle with the remaining Cheddar. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake casserole in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn on the broiler and broil until the top is golden, 2 to 3 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve hot and enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
